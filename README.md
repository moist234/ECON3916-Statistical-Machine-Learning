# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository serves as my digital portfolio for **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**, where I explore how modern data science techniques can extend and enhance traditional economic analysis.

## 👋 About Me

I am an undergraduate economics student with strong interests in **Data Analysis, Economic Consulting, and Finance**.  
My academic focus is on bridging the gap between **economic theory** and **practical, data-driven decision making**.

Through this portfolio, I aim to demonstrate my ability to:
- Apply rigorous economic reasoning
- Work comfortably with real-world data
- Translate statistical results into meaningful economic insights

## 📁 About This Portfolio

This repository contains my **coursework, labs, and projects** for ECON 3916.

The course follows a **Concept Extension philosophy**:
- We begin with foundational statistical tools used in economics (e.g., linear regression, hypothesis testing).
- We then **scale these ideas** using modern Machine Learning methods (e.g., Lasso, regularization, predictive modeling).

A key theme throughout my work is learning how to **combine causal inference with predictive analytics** — understanding not just *what* predicts outcomes, but *why* those relationships exist.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

I am actively developing proficiency with the following tools and libraries:

- 🐍 **Python**
- 📊 **Pandas**
- 🤖 **Scikit-learn**
- 📈 **Statsmodels**
- ☁️ **Google Colab**

These tools allow me to move seamlessly from data cleaning and exploration to statistical modeling and machine learning.
